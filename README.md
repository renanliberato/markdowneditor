# Markdown Editor

This is a desktop markdown editor I'm developing to practice and improve my Java/JavaFX and any other used techonologies knowledge.

## Objectives

This project is in progress and I hope to implemented some basic and cool features:

- Multiple open files support through tabs.
- Working directory on left side.
- Pages instead of vertical scroll to write and preview (I think this will be the _icing on the cake_).
